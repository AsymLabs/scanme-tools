          <p>A set of Bash tools to install and use HP scanners on almost any Linux/Unix </p>

<a name="scanme-tools--" class="anchor" href="#scanme-tools--"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>scanme-tools  </h1>

<p>scanme-tools was created to enable an HP 1220 AIO scanner and printer to be used under 32/64 bit Arch Linux / systemd / Gnome.  It could be useful for other devices but non-hp scanners (ie Epson, Brother or others for example) will require different drivers.  Obviously each manufacturer will do things in their own way.  </p>

<p>The scanme-tools scripts <code>scanme</code> and <code>install.sh</code> are written in Bash.  They are intended for use in Linux (Unix) systems.  </p>

<p>While we have used this script for some time, and have found it very reliable, it has not been extensively tested.  Therefore you may find a problem from time to time.  Please let us know about it.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h2>

<p>Why produce another set of tools, you say?  Well we find that the current tools are not complete, are not reliable or have other drawbacks.  So this tool can scan document after document without problem.  At least that is our experience.</p>

<p>Additionally, in practice we need files that are small, that can be sent as emails, and also files that are high quality, for archival purposes. This functionality is automatically included in this script.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="features-and-usage" class="anchor" href="#features-and-usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features and Usage</h2>

<p>The application <code>scanme</code> installs under the menu categories Multimedia and Office of Gnome, and is installed on the path /usr/local/bin. It can be invoked from the menu or a terminal window, but the behaviour from the terminal is different.  </p>

<p>When accessed from the menu (best), a properties window is used to invoke the application and a terminal provides backgorund messages just in case something goes wrong.  Post processing of files permits the scanned image or document to have metadata attached to it.  This metadata has default settings that the user can accept or change.  The properties window also permits multiple, single or single scan with view to be invoked.  The view will use a pdf viewer, as scans are .tiff files and these are converted to optimized .pdf.  </p>

<p><img src="screenshots/scanme-screenshot_0.png" alt="View of Properties Window"></p>

<p>After selecting the scan type (ie. Single, Single View or Multiple), we pause and get ready to start:  </p>

<p><img src="screenshots/scanme-screenshot_1.png" alt="View of Properties Window"></p>

<p>The final step of Single View scan type is shown below, using the Acrobat reader to view the file:  </p>

<p><img src="screenshots/scanme-screenshot_2.png" alt="View of Properties Window"></p>

<p>From the terminal, ScanMe can be invoked as follows:  </p>

<pre><code>scanme [-s|--single|-v|--view|-m|--multi|-h|--help]  
</code></pre>

<p>The above arguments are optional.  Without arguments the behaviour is the same as calling ScanMe from a menu.  </p>

<p>When an option is given, the properties cannot be changed.  This is meant to offer a fast-track approach.  Options permit a single page to be scanned, a single page with view (either acroread, evince, xpdf or gv are invoked), or multiple pages with no view can be requested.  The help option produces the simple message above.  </p>

<p>Scanned images are saved to a home subdirectory 'ScanMe-Work'. Two images are produced: .tiff and .pdf.  Each .tiff image tends to be about 6 to 7 MB size, typically, but the .pdf will be much smaller, around 200 to 400 KB.  </p>

<p>For multiple scans, each image file is sequenced as -0000.tiff to -9999.tiff/.pdf.  This is a sequential number that will permit the images to stitched together if required.  At the moment ScanMe does not do this stitching, but we are working on another set of PDF tools that can do this work.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="configuration" class="anchor" href="#configuration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuration</h2>

<p>We have found that CUPS+HPLIP is fine for printing, but that HPOJ is needed for proper scanning with HP All-In-One devices such as Laserjet and Officejet AIO.  Before installing, note that the package requires cups, sane, hplip, hpoj, libtiff (tiff2pdf), ghostscript and yad (a better Zenity).  </p>

<p>At the time of writing (February 2014), the HP configuration tools will require python 2.x.  So if strange errors occur, this is likely to be a cause.  </p>

<p>This is systemd compatible, some systems may still use the older sysinit but eventually all sysinit will be replaced by systemd.  Red Hat, Gentoo and CentOS may still use sysinit, but just about all other major distributions use systemd since about 2012.  Note that HPOJ provides the ptal server and installs sysinit scripts by default.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>The script install.sh can be invoked to install and uninstall the system.  Options are:  </p>

<pre><code>sudo ./install.sh {install|uninstall}  
</code></pre>

<p>The above invocation should be done as a part of the procedure outlined below.  This is to ensure that the dependencies are correctly set up first.  When an existing file is found in /etc, it will be backed up with the extension .scanmesave.  This is only done the first time.  When uninstalled, these original files are restored and all .scanmesave files are then removed.  </p>

<p>For files installed under /usr, no backups are made, new files are either put in the target directory or, if the file already exists, it will be overwritten.  </p>

<p>Thus <code>./install.sh install</code> can be invoked more than once without uninstalling should the software need to be updated.</p>

<p>Under this scenario we make no promise as to the integrity of the installation procedure.  You have been warned!</p>

<p>If sysinit is used, rather than systemd, then comment out the paths array entry for 'ptal.service' as follows:  </p>

<pre><code># paths['ptal.service']='/etc/systemd/system'  
</code></pre>

<p>Thus for sysinit, you will probably get an error during installation, and you will have to manually ensure the ptal service is running and enabled.  Then, given a working Bash, awk, sed, and mktemp, do:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Install cups, sane, hplip, hpoj, libtiff (tiff2pdf), ghostscript, and yad.<br>
</li>
<li>Set up the aio device under cups and ensure it works properly.<br>
</li>
<li>Do <code>sudo hp-setup</code>, <code>sudo hp-plugins</code> and <code>sudo ptal-init</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>Do <code>hp-check -t</code> and copy the device string beginning with 'hpoj:mlc:'.<br>
</li>
<li>Edit <code>scanme</code> and set <code>readonly device={device of step above}</code>.<br>
</li>
<li>Modify if using sysinit, as indicated above, otherwise just invoke <code>./install.sh install</code>.<br>
</li>
</ul><p>To uninstall the system, invoke <code>./install.sh uninstall</code>.  This will reinstate the original files under /etc and will remove all previously installed files under /usr.</p>
